Objects and its internal representation in JS



1. In JavaScript, itâ€™s most important data-type and almost everything is an object.

2. It is used to store various keyed collections and Objects can be 
   created using the Object() constructor or the object initializer / literal syntax.
 
  Ex :syntax of object is  Key : value 
        const person = {
        firstName: "Gokul",
        lastName: "Ram",
        age: 20
        };
